The array `[1, null, 2, 3]` represents a binary tree where:

- The value `1` is the root node.
- The root node has a null left child.
- The root node's right child has a value of `2`.
- The right child of node `2` has a value of `3`.

So, the structure of the tree is:

```
     1
    /  \
   4    2
  /    /
 5    3
```

In this tree:
- Node `1` is the root.
- Node `2` is the right child of node `1`.
- Node `3` is the left child of node `2`.

This is a simple representation of a binary tree using an array where each element in the array corresponds to a node in the binary tree, and the position of an element in the array determines its relationship with other nodes in the tree.
