## Question2: explain order of the sql

```sql
select a.id, b.name, count(1) as cn 
from table a inner join table b
on a.id = b.id
where b.name is not null
group by a.id,b.name
having cn > 2
order by a.di;
```

1. join the table a and table b ;
2. filter the result by `where` clause
3. aggrage the result by `group by ` clause
4. filter the aggregated result by `having ` clause
5. fetch the chosen columns in the result
6. apply `order by` clause using the assigned column.

## Question3: Query these 2 columns with 1 query

select 
from table
where  typeid = "1"
group by userid 



## [Hive] - Better to have

in the daily hive develpement , I have ever encounter these issues below:
1. the original files in HDFS are small volumn-sized but very huge of them, in such scenario, we ofter conbine the files with same structure into some big volumn-sized ones, by this way , it will improve hive performance
2. data skew , when we try to join two big tables, found there are some hot values in the join columns, in such case, it will caused sata skewing problem and the execution performance will be low , in such scenario , we can use dynamic partitions or use more partitions to get rid of problem that caused by  data skew.
